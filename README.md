Analysis pipelines used for our study, "24-hour time-use composition and cognitive function in older adults: cross-sectional findings of the ACTIVate study"

Physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep are associated with cognitive function in older adults. However, these behaviours are not independent, but instead make up exclusive and exhaustive components of the 24-hour day. Few studies have investigated associations between 24-hour time-use composition and cognitive function in older adults. Of these, none have considered how the quality of sleep, or the context of physical activity and sedentary behaviour may impact these relationships. This study aimed to understand how 24-hour time-use composition is associated with cognitive function across a range of domains in healthy older adults, and whether the level of recreational physical activity, amount of television (TV) watching, or the quality of sleep impact these potential associations.
